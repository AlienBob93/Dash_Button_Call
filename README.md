# Dash_Button_Call
Call a phone number (or really do anything allowed by IFTTT) when a dash button is pressed

This program uses IFTTT's maker channel to trigger events when an Amazon Dash button is pressed.
The Dash button isn't configured all the way through, you exit the configuration on the product selection page after the wifi connection to the button is established.
